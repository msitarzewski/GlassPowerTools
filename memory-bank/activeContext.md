# Active context

Where the work is now. Rewritten 2026-09-27; the session-by-session log it replaces is in git
history, and each piece of work's evidence is in its task note under `tasks/2026-09/`.

## State: release preparation, no new features

The owner decided on 2026-09-26 to stop adding features and prepare the first public release.
All four capabilities (terminal, databases, remote desktops, editor) and the shell are built; see
`progress.md` for what is verified and how.

**Authorization in force:** local edits, tests, builds and local commits for release preparation.
**Not authorized without the owner's explicit word:** pushing, opening pull requests or issues
upstream, deploying the site, the git history rewrite, installing over a running copy of the app,
anything touching real servers (SSH and database tests use the disposable test VM only).

## Release-prep checklist

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Licences and acknowledgements | done (`2026-09-26_licensing-and-acknowledgements.md`) |
| 2 | Dependency refresh | done within reach: point releases, SwiftTerm 1.18; tree-sitter 0.27 and swift-crypto 5 blocked upstream (`techContext.md`) |
| 3 | Public-release audit fixes | done (`2026-09-27_release-audit-fixes.md`) |
| 4 | Memory bank curated | done; quotes paraphrased; `.brain/` untracked |
| 5 | README, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, building guide | done |
| 6 | Upstream contributions (swift-nio-ssh, Citadel) | drafted locally for the owner's review; nothing sent |
| 7 | Help, site and the Mac release path (D38, D39) | built (`2026-09-27_help-site-and-updates.md`); the owner's steps remain: the Sparkle key, the Developer ID profile, deploying the site |
| 8 | History rewrite, then the first push | only on the owner's word |

## Paused 2026-09-28 (evening) — where to pick up

All work below is committed locally (nothing pushed). Mac 0.4.249, iPhone 0.4.249, Vision Pro 0.4.251.
Detail: `tasks/2026-09/2026-09-27_glassdt-parity-audit.md` (desktop parity, sync repairs, list sweep).

**Next, in the owner's order when they return:**
1. **visionOS unwind, pass 2** — **approved (D40): full unwind, library window first.** Owner's direction (2026-09-28):
   *leave it to Apple to define what spatial is best.* The list rows are done (`glassSpatialList`,
   `glassSpatialListRow`; rows never add gaze highlight or padding). Still ours: `GlassSpatialMetrics`
   type/size scale (24 uses), custom window frames (`GlassNativeWindowFrame`, `GlassCanvasBackdrop`,
   `GlassLayeredWindow`/`Panel`, 8 `.windowStyle(.plain)` scenes), 4 hand-built ornaments, 7 custom
   glass backgrounds, the split Connect capsule. Keep: terminal/desktop transparency and the desktop's
   colour key, and the desktop control bar. Proposed order: library window first, judged on the headset.
2. **Stats in the empty library detail** (total machines, services per machine, connection timeline,
   availability) and **status dots as an option** — **approved (D41): counts + timeline from
   on-device history; dots a setting, off by default, TCP connect only.**
3. **Richer clipboard** — **approved (D42), in order:** RDP text/rich text/images, RDP files,
   Files (SFTP) ⌘C/⌘V and drag with Finder, VNC Extended Clipboard.
4. Desktops in Active "a little wonky" — cause not yet described by the owner.

**Before letting any device with an old install sync:** dry-run the Mac first
(`GLASS_SYNC_DRY_RUN=1`, see the audit note's sync sections).

## Open questions for the owner

- Delete the legacy `SFTPRemoteEditorView` sheet? (Recommended.)
- Take SwiftTerm 1.19, which adds a build-tool plugin Xcode must be told to trust?
- Behaviour and design findings from the help audit, not changed: the widget reads data the app no
  longer writes (fix or drop for 1.0?); local editor projects sync to devices that cannot open them;
  the Editor off the Mac has no Find, no way to close a lone document, no blank editor; the database settings page may be unreachable (the desktop's is fixed); the database "Rows per page" field does nothing; a mistyped
  terminal password is saved before sign-in is tried (fix: save only on success); no way to view or
  forget a trusted host key; imported desktops default to device-only passwords.

## Working rules that matter right now

- Privacy (rule 61): no real machine names, addresses, device identifiers, hosting details or code
  names in tracked files.
- Every shortcut has one owner (D37, rule 60); read the running app's menu bar after changing one.
- Prove a test fails without its fix before trusting it.
- After `swift package update`, run `Tools/Packages/sync-xcode-pins.py`; `PackagePinAgreementTests`
  fails if Xcode's pins and the package's differ.
