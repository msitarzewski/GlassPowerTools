# Active context

Where the work is now. Rewritten 2026-09-27; the session-by-session log it replaces is in git
history, and each piece of work's evidence is in its task note under `tasks/2026-09/`.

## State: release preparation, no new features

The owner decided on 2026-09-26 to stop adding features and prepare the first public release.
All four capabilities (terminal, databases, remote desktops, editor) and the shell are built; see
`progress.md` for what is verified and how.

**Authorization in force:** local edits, tests, builds and local commits for release preparation.
**Not authorized without the owner's explicit word:** pushing, opening pull requests or issues
upstream, deploying the site, the git history rewrite, installing over a running copy of the app,
anything touching real servers (SSH and database tests use the disposable test VM only).

## Release-prep checklist

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Licences and acknowledgements | done (`2026-09-26_licensing-and-acknowledgements.md`) |
| 2 | Dependency refresh | done within reach: point releases, SwiftTerm 1.18; tree-sitter 0.27 and swift-crypto 5 blocked upstream (`techContext.md`) |
| 3 | Public-release audit fixes | done (`2026-09-27_release-audit-fixes.md`) |
| 4 | Memory bank curated | done; quotes paraphrased; `.brain/` untracked |
| 5 | README, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, building guide | done |
| 6 | Upstream contributions (swift-nio-ssh, Citadel) | drafted locally for the owner's review; nothing sent |
| 7 | Help, site and the Mac release path (D38, D39) | built (`2026-09-27_help-site-and-updates.md`); the owner's steps remain: the Sparkle key, the Developer ID profile, deploying the site |
| 8 | History rewrite, then the first push | only on the owner's word |

## 2026-10-07 — where things stand

**Installed:** Mac 0.4.281, iPhone 0.4.280, Vision Pro 0.4.283 (the pinch-measuring build; normal
unless launched with `GLASS_PINCH_PROBE=1`). Everything committed; nothing pushed.

Built and committed 2026-10-01 → 07 (task notes in `tasks/2026-10/`):
- Desktop passwords lost on every device (inferred: a merged duplicate's shared credential deleted)
  — fixed; password changes keep their credential ID.
- **D44 tmux stage 1:** terminals in tmux, offered once per server, reattach on reconnect, Active
  lists sessions running on hosts, Detach wording, tmux-aware close confirmations, AI assistant and
  Open Folder Here ask tmux for the directory. Stage 2 (synced "open the same set here") not started.
- Green "connected" dots on services; an opened running session leaves Active's list.
- iPhone landscape terminal (phone layout on every iPhone, Tools in the top bar, true row count);
  AI fixes that are advice are never run; icons in every machine menu.
- **RDP in-session bandwidth measurements** reported 0 bytes (only payload PDUs counted) — fixed and
  verified live against the Windows 11 VM; likely part of the owner's slow desktops on the headset.
- **D45 database through another machine,** and a Database address for a tunnel through the
  database's own machine (the shape the owner actually used; verified on the owner's server).
- The Active Connections bolt is last on the right on every Mac toolbar (database panes add it
  themselves; measured with an off-screen toolbar layout test, confirmed by the owner).
- Trackpad scroll events reach the remote desktop (a Mac's trackpad driving Vision Pro; confirmed).
- Database scroll views use a hard top scroll edge on the Mac — **not yet seen by the owner**.

**In progress, uncommitted (2026-10-08: 0.4.294 installed on Mac, iPhone and Vision Pro; the owner
works in a local tmux tab, so Mac installs no longer end the session, and the tab reattaches by
itself after the install — verified):** Workgroups on the
shared row with one row height everywhere; tab names from the shell's title or directory and rename
in the sidebar or title; the activity wave; Finder drop as escaped paths; **D47 local terminals kept
in tmux** (Settings → Terminal; tmux 3.7c now installed); **D48 SwiftTerm 1.20** (answers XTVERSION,
so Claude Code uses synchronized output), the Mac's environment in local terminals, and the
dependency update check (`Tools/Packages/check-updates.py`, weekly LaunchAgent); closing a local tmux
tab detaches and Active lists This Mac's sessions; scrolling in tmux (local and SSH, Mac) scrolls
tmux's history; the headset's Connections window can no longer lock the app out (value-keyed window
group); favourites sync (D49). Proposed: D50, reaching This Mac's terminals from other devices. Task note:
`tasks/2026-10/2026-10-07_terminal-tabs-and-local-tmux.md`. The owner runs this session inside the
app, so an install ends it — resume with `claude --continue`. Commit in pieces on the owner's word.

**Open, owner's call:**
- **D46 (Proposed): palm-up pinch-drag = scroll, pinch-and-hold = right-click on Vision Pro.**
  Measured: palm direction is the pinch pose's `up` (right hand) / `−up` (left), z toward the viewer;
  away ≈ −0.8, toward +0.68 (right) / +0.40 (left); threshold +0.2. The pose comes only from a SwiftUI
  `SpatialEventGesture`, which takes all input and carries no mouse buttons, so the trackpad's
  two-finger right-click would be lost. Proposed fix: switch between a hands mode and a trackpad
  mode on what is in use. Pending: does trackpad hover still reach UIKit while the gesture is on?
- The slow production query (100 rows, 9.5 s): our tunnel and MySQL path measured fast on scratch
  (50 MB of rows in 0.2 s); the owner was given two queries to split data volume from the server.
- Vision Pro tab bars expanding together across windows; release steps (Sparkle key, Developer ID
  profile, site deploy, scrub, history rewrite and first push — owner's word only).

**Headset connection:** it was unreachable for days because a full-tunnel VPN on the Mac blocked local
network discovery; once LAN access was allowed it appeared. Installing over a running app on the
headset does not restart it — relaunch with `devicectl device process launch --terminate-existing`.

## Paused 2026-09-28 (evening) — where to pick up

All work below is committed locally (nothing pushed). Mac 0.4.266, iPhone 0.4.249, Vision Pro 0.4.254
(the headset was unreachable; its next build must be cut fresh — 0.4.264 predates Mac glass).
Detail: `tasks/2026-09/2026-09-27_glassdt-parity-audit.md` (desktop parity, sync repairs, list sweep).

**Next, in the owner's order when they return:**
1. **visionOS unwind, pass 2** — **approved (D40), narrowed 2026-09-28:** all window transparency stays; only list formats and non-Glass custom chrome change; database: only the results tool bar (in progress: icon buttons + More menu). Owner's direction (2026-09-28):
   *leave it to Apple to define what spatial is best.* The list rows are done (`glassSpatialList`,
   `glassSpatialListRow`; rows never add gaze highlight or padding). Still ours: `GlassSpatialMetrics`
   type/size scale (24 uses), custom window frames (`GlassNativeWindowFrame`, `GlassCanvasBackdrop`,
   `GlassLayeredWindow`/`Panel`, 8 `.windowStyle(.plain)` scenes), 4 hand-built ornaments, 7 custom
   glass backgrounds, the split Connect capsule. Keep: terminal/desktop transparency and the desktop's
   colour key, and the desktop control bar. Proposed order: library window first, judged on the headset.
2. **Stats in the empty library detail** (total machines, services per machine, connection timeline,
   availability) and **status dots as an option** — **approved (D41): counts + timeline from
   on-device history; dots a setting, off by default, TCP connect only.**
3. **Richer clipboard** — **approved (D42), in order:** RDP text/rich text/images, RDP files,
   Files (SFTP) ⌘C/⌘V and drag with Finder, VNC Extended Clipboard.
4. Desktops in Active "a little wonky" — cause not yet described by the owner.

**2026-09-29 (Mac 0.4.253, committed):** database results bar as icon buttons + a More menu (not the
iPhone's pager); "Statement Completed" fills the pane so the pager stays at its foot; the Mac gutter's
offset is a view conversion (the SQL pane's "1" sat a line low); a sync request arriving mid-pass
waits for the pass; ⌘W → Discard on an editor's last document hides the window at once and closes it
once the sheet has gone — the owner confirmed it on the Mac. Flaky only in full-suite runs, not
investigated (terminal, outside the owner's scope): `macImportedThemeAndPortableAppearanceApplyAfterICloudMerge`,
`abandonedStartupCommandTicketExpires`; both pass alone.

**2026-09-29, headset round (Vision Pro 0.4.254):** the editor's panel has square corners; Files hides
its selection circles until Select… or a swipe (as on iOS); the library's iCloud row is plain text
with only the cloud as a button. **Open:** looking at one window's tab bar expanded the library's and
the database table's tab bars too (owner's capture). Nothing documented explains it (HIG says a tab
bar expands for its own window). Proposed, awaiting the owner's go: the database table's
Data/Structure/DDL/Indexes/Foreign Keys as a segmented control on visionOS, leaving the library as
the only tab bar; test with the windows apart to tell our setup from a visionOS bug. Also open: the
remote desktop is slow on the headset (connecting vs live session not yet described).

**2026-09-30:** D43 schema diagram built (task note `2026-09-30_schema-diagram.md`); one
Connections window on visionOS; every ⚡ opens Active; five help pages corrected; README and the
databases page list the diagram. Committed on the owner's word.

**Backlog run, 2026-09-30 (owner: "create a plan and build your list"):** all eleven items built and
committed — see `tasks/2026-09/2026-09-30_backlog-run.md` for each commit and its evidence. Owed: an
install on the Mac and headset, RDP autodetect against Windows, Open With from the Finder.

**After the run (owner on the Mac, 0.4.265–0.4.266):** Settings on the Mac sizes itself to its tabs
(Editor was lost in the toolbar's overflow); desktop glass (Opacity, Background Frost) now on the
Mac too — glassDT had it on the headset only. README and the desktops page list both, with adaptive
streaming.

**Before letting any device with an old install sync:** dry-run the Mac first
(`GLASS_SYNC_DRY_RUN=1`, see the audit note's sync sections).

## Open questions for the owner

- Delete the legacy `SFTPRemoteEditorView` sheet? (Recommended.)
- Behaviour and design findings from the help audit, not changed: the widget reads data the app no
  longer writes (fix or drop for 1.0?); local editor projects sync to devices that cannot open them;
  the Editor off the Mac has no Find, no way to close a lone document, no blank editor; the database settings page may be unreachable (the desktop's is fixed); the database "Rows per page" field does nothing; the terminal
  password, trusted host keys, imported-desktop mobility, Rows per page, the database settings page
  and the editor's Find/close were fixed on 2026-09-30.

## Working rules that matter right now

- Privacy (rule 61): no real machine names, addresses, device identifiers, hosting details or code
  names in tracked files.
- Every shortcut has one owner (D37, rule 60); read the running app's menu bar after changing one.
- Prove a test fails without its fix before trusting it.
- After `swift package update`, run `Tools/Packages/sync-xcode-pins.py`; `PackagePinAgreementTests`
  fails if Xcode's pins and the package's differ.
